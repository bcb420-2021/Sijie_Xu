abstract = {Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells reside in lymphoid organs and barrier tissues where they control different types of inflammatory responses. Treg cells are also found in human cancers, and studies in animal models suggest that they contribute to cancer progression. However, properties of human intratumoral Treg cells and those present in corresponding normal tissue remain largely unknown. Here, we analyzed features of Treg cells in untreated human breast carcinomas, normal mammary gland, and peripheral blood. Tumor-resident Treg cells were potently suppressive and their gene-expression pattern resembled that of normal breast tissue, but not of activated peripheral blood Treg cells. Nevertheless, a number of cytokine and chemokine receptor genes, most notably CCR8, were upregulated in tumor-resident Treg cells in comparison to normal tissue-resident ones. Our studies suggest that targeting CCR8 for the depletion of tumor-resident Treg cells might represent a promising immunotherapeutic approach for the treatment of breast cancer.}

abstract = { Maintenance of genomic stability is a critical determinant of cell survival and relies on the coordinated action of the DNA damage response (DDR), which orchestrates a network of cellular processes, including DNA replication, DNA repair and cell-cycle progression. In cancer, the critical balance between the loss of genomic stability in malignant cells and the DDR provides exciting therapeutic opportunities. Drugs targeting DDR pathways taking advantage of clinical synthetic lethality have already shown therapeutic benefit – for example, the PARP inhibitor olaparib has shown benefit in BRCA-mutant ovarian and breast cancer. Olaparib has also shown benefit in metastatic prostate cancer in DDR-defective patients, expanding the potential biomarker of response beyond BRCA. Other agents and combinations aiming to block the DDR while pushing damaged DNA through the cell cycle, including PARP, ATR, ATM, CHK and DNA-PK inhibitors, are in development. Emerging work is also uncovering how the DDR interacts intimately with the host immune response, including by activating the innate immune response, further suggesting that clinical applications together with immunotherapy may be beneficial. Here, we review recent considerations related to the DDR from a clinical standpoint, providing a framework to address future directions and clinical opportunities. }

BRCA1 has been implicated in a number of important cellular functions including DNA damage repair, transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and ubiquitination. Using an Affymetrix U95A microarray, IRF-7 was identified as a BRCA1 transcriptional target and was also shown to be synergistically up-regulated by BRCA1 specifically in the presence of IFN-γ, coincident with the synergistic induction of apoptosis. We show that BRCA1, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1, and STAT2 are all required for the induction of IRF-7 following stimulation with IFN-γ. We also show that the induction of IRF-7 by BRCA1 and IFN-γ is dependent on the type I IFNs, IFN-α and IFN-β. We show that BRCA1 is required for the up-regulation of STAT1, STAT2, and the type I IFNs in response to IFN-γ. We show that BRCA1 is localized at the promoters of the molecules involved in type I IFN signaling leading to their up-regulation. Blocking this intermediary type I IFN step using specific antisera shows the requirement for IFN-α and IFN-β in the induction of IRF-7 and apoptosis. Finally, we outline a mechanism for the BRCA1/IFN-γ regulation of target genes involved in the innate immune response, which is dependent on type I IFN signaling.

    abstract = {Background Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally, the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal.  Principal Findings To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed “Enrichment Map”, a network-based visualization method for gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where each set is a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups related gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the enrichment results.  Conclusions Enrichment Map is a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any research project that generates a list of genes can take advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment Map is implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for the Cytoscape network visualization software (http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap/).},

  Abstract = {Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is an autosomal recessive human disease due to mutations in the thymidine phosphorylase (TP) gene. TP enzyme catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of thymidine to thymine and 2-deoxy-D-ribose 1-phosphate. We present evidence that thymidine metabolism is altered in MNGIE. TP activities in buffy coats were reduced drastically in all 27 MNGIE patients compared with 19 controls. All MNGIE patients had much higher plasma levels of thymidine than normal individuals and asymptomatic TP mutation carriers. In two patients, the renal clearance of thymidine was approximately 20% that of creatinine, and because hemodialysis demonstrated that thymidine is ultrafiltratable, most of the filtered thymidine is likely to be reabsorbed by the kidney. In vitro, fibroblasts from controls catabolized thymidine in medium; by contrast, MNGIE fibroblasts released thymidine. In MNGIE, severe impairment of TP enzyme activity leads to increased plasma thymidine. In patients who are suspected of having MNGIE, determination of TP activity in buffy coats and thymidine levels in plasma are diagnostic. We hypothesize that excess thymidine alters mitochondrial nucleoside and nucleotide pools leading to impaired mitochondrial DNA replication, repair, or both. Therapies to reduce thymidine levels may be beneficial to MNGIE patients.},

  Abstract = {We report here the isolation of Tel-2, a novel member of the Ets transcription factor family, with high homology to Tel/ETV-6. Tel-2 is the second mammalian member of the Tel Ets family subclass whose prototype Tel is involved in various chromosomal translocations in human cancers. Six differentially expressed alternative splice products of Tel-2 were characterized encoding different Tel-2 isoforms which either contain or lack the amino-terminal Pointed domain and also vary at the carboxyl terminus. In contrast to Tel, which is highly expressed in several different cell types and tissues, Tel-2 is only weakly expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types, including placenta, prostate, spleen, liver, and lung. Tel-2 binds to functionally relevant Ets-binding sites of several genes and only the Tel-2 isoform containing the Pointed domain and the DNA-binding domain acts as a strong repressor of transcription. The retinoic acid receptor alpha and bone morphogenetic protein-6B (BMP-6) genes are specifically repressed by Tel-2 indicating a function for Tel-2 as an inhibitor of differentiation. Due to the important involvement of Tel in human cancer and the location of Tel-2 within the MHC cluster region, Tel-2 might be involved in chromosomal translocations in human cancer as well.},
