abstract = {Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells reside in lymphoid organs and barrier tissues where they control different types of inflammatory responses. Treg cells are also found in human cancers, and studies in animal models suggest that they contribute to cancer progression. However, properties of human intratumoral Treg cells and those present in corresponding normal tissue remain largely unknown. Here, we analyzed features of Treg cells in untreated human breast carcinomas, normal mammary gland, and peripheral blood. Tumor-resident Treg cells were potently suppressive and their gene-expression pattern resembled that of normal breast tissue, but not of activated peripheral blood Treg cells. Nevertheless, a number of cytokine and chemokine receptor genes, most notably CCR8, were upregulated in tumor-resident Treg cells in comparison to normal tissue-resident ones. Our studies suggest that targeting CCR8 for the depletion of tumor-resident Treg cells might represent a promising immunotherapeutic approach for the treatment of breast cancer.}

abstract = { Maintenance of genomic stability is a critical determinant of cell survival and relies on the coordinated action of the DNA damage response (DDR), which orchestrates a network of cellular processes, including DNA replication, DNA repair and cell-cycle progression. In cancer, the critical balance between the loss of genomic stability in malignant cells and the DDR provides exciting therapeutic opportunities. Drugs targeting DDR pathways taking advantage of clinical synthetic lethality have already shown therapeutic benefit – for example, the PARP inhibitor olaparib has shown benefit in BRCA-mutant ovarian and breast cancer. Olaparib has also shown benefit in metastatic prostate cancer in DDR-defective patients, expanding the potential biomarker of response beyond BRCA. Other agents and combinations aiming to block the DDR while pushing damaged DNA through the cell cycle, including PARP, ATR, ATM, CHK and DNA-PK inhibitors, are in development. Emerging work is also uncovering how the DDR interacts intimately with the host immune response, including by activating the innate immune response, further suggesting that clinical applications together with immunotherapy may be beneficial. Here, we review recent considerations related to the DDR from a clinical standpoint, providing a framework to address future directions and clinical opportunities. }

	abstract = {BRCA1 encodes a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in the germ line of women with a genetic predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 has been implicated in a number of important cellular functions including DNA damage repair, transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and ubiquitination. Using an Affymetrix U95A microarray, IRF-7 was identified as a BRCA1 transcriptional target and was also shown to be synergistically up-regulated by BRCA1 specifically in the presence of IFN-γ, coincident with the synergistic induction of apoptosis. We show that BRCA1, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1, and STAT2 are all required for the induction of IRF-7 following stimulation with IFN-γ. We also show that the induction of IRF-7 by BRCA1 and IFN-γ is dependent on the type I IFNs, IFN-α and IFN-β. We show that BRCA1 is required for the up-regulation of STAT1, STAT2, and the type I IFNs in response to IFN-γ. We show that BRCA1 is localized at the promoters of the molecules involved in type I IFN signaling leading to their up-regulation. Blocking this intermediary type I IFN step using specific antisera shows the requirement for IFN-α and IFN-β in the induction of IRF-7 and apoptosis. Finally, we outline a mechanism for the BRCA1/IFN-γ regulation of target genes involved in the innate immune response, which is dependent on type I IFN signaling.

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation.
